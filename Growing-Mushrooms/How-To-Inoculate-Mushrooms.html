		  <p>Our mushroom logs /composts containing growing media/substrate inoculated with mushroom spawn. The white/brown material inside the bags is the &ldquo;mycelium&rdquo;, which has &ldquo;colonized&rdquo; the growing media/substrate. These bags are kept in the &ldquo;spawn room&rdquo; until fully colonized, and then be ready to ship to our customers. You can harvest the 1st flush/crop in about 7-11 days after the bags arrived at you. <img style="max-width: 70%; margin: 3px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512595594595-82b7f049313b?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MTI4fHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="grow+bed" align="right" /></p>
<p>Gourmet mushrooms add flavor and nutrition to a meal, but they can be expensive to buy from retail stores. Because of the time it takes to process and ship mushrooms, store-bought varieties can also be past their peak time of flavor, which lasts only a few days. Growing fresh mushrooms outdoors at home requires minimal upkeep; if properly cared for, the mushrooms will continue to grow and sustain themselves for years without the need to plant, or inoculate, a new bed. Shiitake (lentinula edodes) and oyster mushrooms (pleurotus spp. ) grow well using this method on hardwood logs from trees such as red oak (quercus rubra), which grows in u.</p>
<p>This interesting thing is many of the same mushrooms we just talked about for growing indoors can also be grown on logs as well. Maybe you don&rsquo;t mind waiting a long time for the mushrooms to grow and you want to inoculate a tree to duplicate their natural environment. In that case, we have decided to write an entire article on the process of finding the right tree log, inoculating it and how to store it during incubation and fruiting:.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have a full, smoky flavor and a dense texture that holds up well for cooking. They're easily found in stores, but you can likely grow them much more inexpensively at home. Growing shiitakes at home is rewarding. It might take a bit of time to get started, but once you&rsquo;re going they can produce sporadic flushes. Choosing your substrate is a very important part of growing shiitake mushrooms. If growing on hardwood logs, shiitakes can be produced for 3 to 5 years once the wood has been inoculated with mushroom spawn.</p>
<h2>Why Risk It? Grow at Home Instead!</h2>
<p>Button mushrooms should appear within three to four weeks. Harvest them when the caps open and the stalk can be cut with a sharp knife from the stem. Avoid pulling up the mushrooms, or you risk damage to surrounding fungi that are still developing. Harvesting every day should result in a continuous crop for about six months. <img style="max-width: 30%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566584165177-924e0862a568?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MTIxfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tcy1vbi1sb2dzfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyMjE3NTc5Ng\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="spawn" align="left" /> Once you set up a mushroom growing station in your home, it's super easy to keep them growing. Eventually, you might need to add fresh spawn to grow more mushrooms, but as long as you keep the cloth damp and harvest the mushrooms as they appear, you should have a steady supply.</p>
<p>This is one big mistake that many users make. Unless you choose the best-rated products in the segment, there is always the risk of contamination. You never know if there are spores of other mushrooms in the batch. Some of them might make you sick, and some might even be poisonous mushrooms. Therefore when you are growing vegetable plants of mushrooms at home, quality seeds and spores are critical.</p>
<p>With the abundance of information and materials available online, growing psilocybin mushrooms has never been more accessible and easy. Beyond being a fun project to undertake, indoor cultivation can generate impressive yields and bypass the inherent risks of gathering psilocybin mushrooms in the wild (e. G. Mistaking them for poisonous varieties). This comprehensive guide, suitable for the beginner grower, will outline how to grow magic mushrooms at home.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 types of mushrooms grow in the world. However, not all of these varieties are edible. Many are poisonous and that is one risk to foraging for mushrooms. One benefit to growing your own mushrooms is that you know they will be safe to eat. The most common types of mushrooms grown at home include cremini, enoki, maitake, portobello, oyster, shiitake, and white button. Each type of mushroom has certain requirements so be sure to be informed of these differences before you start growing.</p>
<h3>Mushroom Plugs and Wood: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>So which type of mushroom spawn is best for your project? the answer depends on what you're doing. A general rule of thumb is to match your spawn to your substrate. For example, if you want to grow mushrooms on logs, a wood-based spawn such as plugs or sawdust is best. The argument is that the mycelium is already familiar with this material, reducing colonization time.</p>
<h2>The Most Comprehensive Guide EVER for Growing Oyster Mushrooms</h2>
<p>This is a dedicated form of gardening that needs to be studied; i suggest you start with home-grown mushrooms from scratch: a practical guide to growing mushrooms outside and indoors , by magdalena and herbert wurth, a comprehensive guide to everything from oyster mushrooms to medicinal reishi. Growing from scratch, or more accurately spores, requires care, so start with a kit and go from there. I got a recycled plastic pot oyster mushroom kit for just under a tenner (from gourmetmushrooms. Co. Uk). It&rsquo;s perfect for the uninitiated, as oyster mushrooms grow in a wide range of conditions.</p>

Within this audiobook, you will discover how mushrooms grow, how to grow mushrooms, the best conditions for growing mushrooms, the types of mushrooms to grow at home, and the exceptional health benefits of consuming some varieties of these fungi.</p>
<h3>Growing Mushrooms Outdoors on Straw</h3>
<p>Growing mushrooms is quite a different ball game than growing other vegetable plants, the fact that mushrooms are fungus, and not green plants, has a lot to do with it. Mushrooms don&rsquo;t contain chlorophyll, so they don&rsquo;t prepare their own food but depend on other plant material like wood, hay, straw and bark for their nutrition. Growing edible mushrooms at home can be challenging if you do everything from the start, but you don&rsquo;t have to. There are mushroom starter kits available in the market that will allow you to grow mushrooms indoors with ease. With some experience you can actually start growing mushrooms on logs and sawdust on your own.</p>
<p>Each different type of mushroom has its own specific growing needs. Shiitakes can be grown on hardwood sawdust or wood. White button mushrooms and portobellos need to be grown on composted manure. Oyster mushrooms will grow on a variety of different substrates including straw and even cardboard or coffee grounds !.</p>
<p>This instruction relates to growing oyster mushrooms&nbsp;from dowels; these are intended for inoculation into&nbsp;hardwood logs. Cultivating mushrooms from logs can&nbsp;be slow at 6-12 months, but gourmets comment that&nbsp;the taste of log-grown oyster is much preferred over&nbsp;faster growing substrates. Oyster dowels can be used&nbsp;for inoculating tree stumps, sawdust, straw, paper&nbsp;products or a variety of alternative substrates,&nbsp;however these instructions cover the use of dowels&nbsp;in logs only.</p>
<p>For your first venture into the world of mushroom growing, try using a kit. These kits contain growing materials, such as straw or sawdust that are typically inoculated with mushroom spores. Some of the kits claim to grow mushrooms within two weeks, but don&rsquo;t lose hope if your mushrooms don&rsquo;t grow right away. Mushroom growth can vary depending on growing conditions and temperature. It might take a month or more for your kit to produce mushrooms.</p>
<p>These hardwood dowels, or &ldquo;plug spawn&rdquo;, have been inoculated with a single species of fungi. Plug spawn is used to inoculate a fresh cut log to encourage the growth and fruiting of a specific species of edible and/or medicinal mushroom. Plug spawn can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4-6 months before use. Log preparation &middot; harvest logs (4-8 inch diameter 3-4 foot long) preferably in fall, winter, or spring before trees buds break. Avoid additional damage to bark while cutting.</p>
<p>Shiitake are a great species to use when you are starting outdoor cultivation. They will grow on logs in your garden. Although they&rsquo;re a lot slower to fruit than oyster mushrooms, if you inoculate a batch of logs every year (or even better, every season), you can soon have a regular supply of shiitakes. Preferred fruiting substrates: hardwood logs of almost every type, though yields will vary according to the log species. Eucalypts work well if you can&rsquo;t find oak, beech or alder. They can also be grown on sawdust.</p>
<p>This fall i've harvested mycelium from 5 species of mushrooms , transferred it onto sterile substrates and stored it in the fridge after they completely colonized the substrate. By now i've stored all crops from my garden and filled my freezer with enough fish and meat for the next months, so it's time to get them out again and start producing spawn to inoculate some logs in spring.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the simplest way of growing mushrooms. Growing mushrooms on logs is by far the easiest way that you can grow your own at home. All you need are some logs, inoculated wooden dowels, a drill and some wax. What kind of wood to use different kinds of mushrooms require different kinds of wood to fruit on. There are numerous species of wood in the tropics that do a great job growing mushrooms. When in doubt, they mostly tend to be nitrogen fixing species, so if you are looking to experiment, start there.</p>
